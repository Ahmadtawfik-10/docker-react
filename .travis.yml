#travis will be watching the output from all of the next commands, and for each command if it returns an exit code other than 0, travis will assume that the build failed or the test failed (or what ever I want to execute failed), so travis doesn't care about stuff that gets printed in the console it only cares about the exit code
#travis will be waiting for commands to finish in order to go the next command, so I have to make the test command runs and exits and doesn't wait for input or other wise travis will still be waiting for the command to exit

  - docker run -e CI=true ahmadtawfik10/docker-react:latest npm run test #the -e CI=true is to let the test command exits when it finishes and don't wait for input
